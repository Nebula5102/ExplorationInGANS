# ExplorationInGANS
\begin{abstract}
This paper is an exploration in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Two types of GANs are discussed: GAN, and WGAN. The main goal is to display the strengths and weaknesses of GAN and WGAN, as well as outline the need for tools to recognize artificially generated images, and understand why GANs may not be the best models suited for that task.
